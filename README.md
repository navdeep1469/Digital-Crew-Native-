# Product Filter App using React Native

This is a React Native app that allows users to filter products based on certain criteria. The app is built using Expo CLI and utilizes the `react-native-elements` library for UI components.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.
3. Run `expo start` to start the development server.

## Usage

To use the app, you can either run it on an emulator/simulator or on your own device using the Expo app:

1. To run the app on an emulator/simulator, choose the appropriate option from the Expo server page that opened in your browser after running `expo start`.
2. To run the app on your own device, download the Expo app from the App Store or Google Play Store.
3. Once the app is downloaded, scan the QR code that appears on the Expo server page with your device's camera. This will open the app on your device.

## Features

The app allows users to:

- View a list of products
- Filter the list of products based on certain criteria (e.g. price, category)
- View details of individual products

## Code Structure

The main code for the app can be found in the `App.js` file in the root of the project. The `components` directory contains reusable UI components used throughout the app. The `screens` directory contains the individual screens that make up the app.
